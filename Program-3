3. What is the difference between a try-catch block and a try-throw-catch block?
Ans.. Try-catch block is used to handle the exception. In a try block, 
we write the code which may throw an exception and in catch block we write code to handle that exception. 
Throw keyword is used to explicitly throw an exception. Generally, throw keyword is used to throw user defined exceptions.
The try statement allows you to define a block of code to be tested for errors while it is being executed.
The throw keyword throws an exception when a problem is detected, which lets us create a custom error.
The catch statement allows you to define a block of code to be executed, if an error occurs in the try block.
