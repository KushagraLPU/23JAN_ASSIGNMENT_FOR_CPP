Ans.If an exception is thrown and not caught anywhere, the program terminates abnormally.
For example, in the following program, a char is thrown, but there is no catch block to catch the char.  */
#include <iostream>

int main()
{
    try  {
       throw 'a';
    }
    catch (int x)  {
        cout << "Caught ";
